 ## Project Description

 With this Film App called "Athenauem" users will be able to search for a film then be provided with the film's title, poster, genre, and synopsis by fetching the information from the OMDb API. The user can then add their favorite films to a list by clicking the "Add to Favorites" button. This App is useful for film lovers with a desire to be able to easily access a library of films that they love.

 ## API

 OMDb: https://www.omdbapi.com

 This API allows users for fetch data on any film within OMDb.
